// Staying reachable with the window closed.
//
// This is the desktop's whole answer to "a call has to ring even with the app
// closed", and it is worth being blunt about why it looks nothing like the
// answer on the other two platforms. A browser and an Android phone can be
// woken by a *push service* — a third party that holds a message until the
// device is next online. Electron has no such thing: there is no server
// anywhere that can deliver anything to a desktop application that is not
// running. Nobody's Electron app has one, which is exactly why every desktop
// chat application converges on the same design instead — the app does not
// close when the window does, it goes to the tray with its connection open,
// and it starts with the system so that "closed" is a state the machine
// rarely gets into.
//
// So there are two settings and they are not independent in effect, only in
// meaning:
//
//   - runInBackground: closing the window hides it instead of quitting.
//     Without this the app is gone the moment somebody presses X, and no
//     amount of anything else brings a ring to it.
//   - openAtLogin: the app starts hidden with the machine. Without this, the
//     first setting only helps until the next reboot.
//
// Both default to *on* for the same reason the feature exists at all, and both
// are visible and reversible from the tray menu — an application that decides
// on its own to keep running and to start itself has to say so somewhere the
// user can find it, or it is indistinguishable from something they would want
// removed.
