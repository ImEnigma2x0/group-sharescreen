// comparisons is the entire policy — it decides, for every viewer in every
// room, whether their picture is allowed to be worse than they asked for —
// and it is the one part of the quality path with no natural safety net. A
// tier that comes out too low is visible and gets reported; a ratio that
// comes out too low looks exactly like a bad network, so it can be wrong
// indefinitely without anybody being able to say so. On its own, with no
// peer connection or sender attached, it can be read, argued with and tested,
// which is what a rule of that reach deserves.

import type { SenderSample } from "./mediaStats";

// Congestion thresholds.
//
// The ratio survives room churn (see PeerQualityController.setTier, which
// deliberately leaves this state alone), which makes every step down a
// lasting scar rather than a transient dip — so the evidence
// required for one is deliberately high: a sample only counts as bad if the
// encoder itself reports being limited *and* these thresholds agree, it takes
// BAD_STREAK_TO_BACKOFF of those in a row, and no single noisy sample (one
// dropped ack, a brief wifi retransmit, a GC pause) can cut anyone's bitrate
// on its own.
//
// The asymmetry runs the other way from what a congestion controller usually
// wants. Backing off hard and recovering slowly is right when the cost of
// overshooting is everyone's stream stalling; here the sender is one of many
// and the browser's own bandwidth estimator is already the fast, correct
// reflex for real congestion. This layer is the slow one on top, so it now
// recovers faster than it retreats (RECOVER > 1/BACKOFF) and stops at a floor
// that is still comfortably watchable, instead of ratcheting toward the
// bottom on the strength of a bad minute.

// a relay, absolutely everybody whenever "Impedir conexões diretas" is on —
// was permanent. Every single sample tripped the bad branch with zero packet
// loss and a perfectly healthy link, so the ratio ratcheted down to MIN_RATIO
// and stayed: recovery required `rtt < 0.2`, which that path can never
// produce. Roughly half the bitrate, for the whole session, for being far
// away. With a lower bitrate dial the resulting share also crossed SCALE_HARD
// below, so the picture was halved in resolution on top of it.
//
// Against a per-peer floor these numbers mean what they say: 150ms of
